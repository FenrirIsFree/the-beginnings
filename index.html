            <h4>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL</h4>
            <p>As I am just starting out with the tech industry, I have a lot to learn and catch up on. To keep track of this I have made this website as a portfolio and a log for the changes of the website over time. I am currently focused on learning <strong>JavaScript</strong> in depth while learning a bit of HTML and CSS to help make the website more enjoyable to look at.
                <br>Starting on <em>January 6th 2023</em> I will be in a 3 month long Full-Stack Engineer Bootcamp through <a href="https://parsity.io/">Parsity.io</a>. There I will add more knowledge about <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong?, and <strong>SQL</strong> to my ever expanding list of tools under my belt. Also I will be learning <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Redux</strong>, <strong>Backbone</strong>, and <strong>NodeJS</strong>. During this time I will also fix any bad habits that might have come into play and also learn more about industry standards.
                <br>Another step in my progress to learning more and learning different perspectives will be through learning <strong>Python</strong>. This is so that I can help my friends with some of their side projects. They have been in this industry for a while and have helped me a lot with my transition but still have more to teach me. The <strong>Python</strong> aspect of this learning is more geared toward data engineering. This will help me expand my horizons and be a more versatile Full-Stack Engineer.
