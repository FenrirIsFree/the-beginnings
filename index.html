                <h3>Current Learning Objectives</h3>
                <h4>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL</h4>
                <p>As I am just starting out in the tech industry which means I have a lot to learn and catch up on. To keep track of this I have made this website as a portfolio and a log for the changes of the website over time. I am currently focused on learning <b>JavaScript</b> in depth while learning a bit of <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> to help make the website more enjoyable to look at.
                    <br><br>Starting on <em>January 6th 2023</em> I will be in a 3 month long Full-Stack Engineer Bootcamp through <a href="https://parsity.io/">Parsity.io</a>. There I will add more knowledge about <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, and <b>SQL</b> to my ever expanding list of tools under my belt. Also I will be learning <b>React</b>, <b>Redux</b>, <b>Backbone</b>, and <b>NodeJS</b>. During this time I will also fix any bad habits that might have come into play and also learn more about industry standards.
                    <br><br>Another step in my progress to learning more and learning different perspectives will be through learning <b>Python</b>. This is so I can help my friends with some of their side projects. They have been in this industry for a while and have helped me a lot with my transition but still have more to teach me. The <b>Python</b> aspect of this learning is more geared toward data engineering. This will help me expand my horizons and be a more versatile Full-Stack Engineer.
